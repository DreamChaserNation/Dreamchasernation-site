Fixes applied:
- Uses RELATIVE paths (assets/...) so CSS/JS load when previewing locally.
- Popup overlay is hidden by default (display:none) and only opens on click.
- Wired 'Join the Nation' CTA to open the popup via data-dcn-open="dcn-comm".

Preview:
- Open index.html locally.
- Click the 'Join the Nation' button; the modal should appear centered.
